# Visualizing the Difference: Why Logistic Regression Outperforms Linear Regression for Classification ðŸ“Š

In my latest ML experiment, I developed a Python animation that visually contrasts logistic regression vs. linear regression for binary classification.

## Key Observations

- âœ… **Clear Decision Boundaries:** Logistic regression quickly finds a crisp boundary, while linear regression struggles with a fuzzy one.
- âœ… **Loss Behavior:** Logistic regression stabilizes its loss rapidly, proving it's tailored for classification.
- âœ… **Interactive Visuals:** Watch as heatmaps and loss curves bring these concepts to life.

**NOTE:** Linear regression struggles with classification (high, slow-decreasing MSE), while logistic regression quickly achieves low cross-entropy loss, proving its natural fit for binary classification tasks.
